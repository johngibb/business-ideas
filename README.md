# Business Ideas

This is just a place for me to dump some ideas for simple web or app
based businesses to work on in my spare time.

## FootSteps

FootSteps is a simple iOS application that guides you to a selected
destination using only an arrow and an estimate of how far away you are.
Like a compass that points to your destination, rather than north.

## Social RSS

A simple RSS reader website that adds the ability to comment on posts.
Like HackerNews, but curated to only blogs you've explicitly decided to
follow.

## RSS as Podcasts

A way to follow blogs and receive them as audiobooks. RSS + Text to
Speech.
